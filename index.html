        <p>It has been an open secret for some time that Netflix has been looking for ways to stop password sharing
            among users. The company even tested ways to find a feasible solution to this. Now, after waiting months for
            the virtual guillotine to drop, Netflix has quietly revealed exact information on how it will crack down on
            password sharing. So if you’re wondering if your days of hogging your friend’s Netflix password are over,
            this guide is for you. We have compiled everything you need to know about Netflix’s new password and
            account-sharing rules in 2023. So without further ado, let’s dive in.</p>

        <h2>Netflix Password Sharing Guidelines (2023)</h2>
        <p>The primary reason behind ending password sharing on Netflix is the lack of profit it creates for the
            company. Since Netflix relies on every user essentially paying for the service, password sharing undercuts
            that decision and sees the company missing out on potential customers. The company said so in its quarterly
            letter to the shareholders recently.

            Calling widespread account sharing a big reason that undermines its ability to invest more in the company,
            Netflix has stated that it will roll out paid sharing soon. In an official statement, Netflix said, “Later
            in Q1, we expect to start rolling out paid sharing more broadly. Today’s widespread account sharing (100Mn+
            households) undermines our long-term ability to invest in and improve Netflix, as well as build our
            business.”</p>
